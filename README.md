# AI Grafimar
Maritime control application. It's so much fun to work in this project. I'm developing this for the Chile's Army, so that they can control maritime traffic. The user can set up alarms for different situations, such as when two vessels are too close together to detect illegal exchanges, or when they are in a forbidden zone and so on.

# "Routine Planner"
I created this program to fulfill the need from instructors of the EasyFlexibility method to have quick lesson plans.

## Technologies:
- .NET with C# for Windows Desktop.
- Text-to-speech modules.
#### It checks the software expiration via an internet clock.
![01- log in](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70539591/114875384-9f3a7200-9dd3-11eb-972c-a7bf69939e15.jpg)

#### Main window of the application. Categories on top, exercises list on the left, exercise information in the center. The pictures are all built within the .exe as "resource".
On the right you have the routine structure, you can add exercises to each tab: warmup, rounds 1 to 3, cool down. The Save Lesson Plan button creates an html and PDF version of the routine.
![02- main window](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70539591/114875590-d1e46a80-9dd3-11eb-887e-b9e3084546fb.jpg)

#### This contains the most complex logic of all the program. It creates a splits lesson plan automatically by picking difficulty and split, whether you want to include a cool down and zejax exercises. It creates a PDF file and it also stores it as a propietary format so that then the program can load it and teach it to you via voice, for you to train following along.

#### The program talks to you so you can follow along the routines you create.

# "GOI" 
Vocabulary retention system. I originally created it to learn Japanese, that's why it has special functionalities to handle "kanji" characters, as well as the two Japanese alphabets (hiragana and katakana).
## Technologies: 
- Borland Delphi (Pascal)
- It uses a propietary file format to handle the vocabulary lists, saving the right and wrong answers for spaced repetition.
